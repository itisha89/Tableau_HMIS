**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the prevalence and impact of childhood diseases, particularly pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, and asthma, in India using data from the Health Management & Information System (HMIS) for the years 2018-19 and 2019-20. The goal is to visualize the data, present actionable insights, and help the Department of Health Research in India implement targeted interventions for disease prevention.

**The main goal is to answer the following questions:**

State-wise Distribution: What is the distribution of the number of cases and deaths due to asthma, diarrhea, measles, and pneumonia across different states for the years 2018-19 and 2019-20?
Sector-wise Distribution: How are asthma, diarrhea, measles, and pneumonia cases and deaths distributed across public, private, urban, and rural sectors in India during the years 2018-19 and 2019-20?
Overall Status: What is the total number of cases and deaths due to asthma, diarrhea, measles, and pneumonia in India across both years?
